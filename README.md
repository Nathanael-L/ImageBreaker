# ImageBreaker

## Inspiration
The Idea for this small script was inspired by a broker sd card of a friend.</br>
Somehow the pictures of the card where concatenated randomly to a very long</br>
image. The random beaviour is written in 'stats' and is cloned from this</br>
sd card image.</br>

## How
Just copy 'ImageBreaker.py' and 'stats' (the given or your own) where ever you</br>
like. Create a directory called 'img' and copy the Images of your choice into 'img'.</br>
Type 'python ImageBreaker.py' - voil√°: The result is written to 'out.jpg'.</br>
The original and default format is 880x25519.</br>
You can also write a custom format: 'python Imagebreaker.py 1024 10192'.

## Install
The scipt runs with a python2.x interpreter. So you need to install
<a href=https://www.python.org/downloads/>python2.x</a>.</br>
I wrote it on Ubuntu 14. Let me know if there is any trouble.
